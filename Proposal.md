# Proposal: WasteWise

### What and why?

WasteWise is a mobile web app focused on reducing food waste and fostering community support. The app helps users receive recipe suggestions based on available ingredients, plan meals, share surplus ingredients or meals within their community, and participate in environmental challenges.

### For whom?

WasteWise is designed for individuals and families seeking to reduce food waste in their households, and/or interested in connecting with their local community through food sharing and mutual support.

### How?

The program provides an private interface for the household's inventory management, recipe recommendations, meal plannings, etc., where the user interacts with our database and apis to get food tips. There would also be a public platform where neighbors post sharable inventories and invite meals. Finally, a reward and challenge system watches all activities to provide appropriate stimulations.

- **Inventory Management:**
  - Users can add food items to their inventory, including purchase dates and expiration dates.
  - Receive expiry date reminders and notifications for soon-to-expire items.

- **Recipe Suggestions:**
  - The app analyzes the user's food inventory and suggests recipes based on available ingredients, or soon-to-expire items, upon user's demand.

- **Meal Planning:**
  - Users can plan their future meals using a built-in calendar function.
  - Generate shopping lists based on number of people to ensure the purchase of necessary ingredients.

- **Community Sharing Platform:**
  - Users can post surplus ingredients, exchange or sell with discounts, eliminating food waste in the community.

- **Shared Meals Platform:**
  - Users can share the meals they plan to prepare, inviting community members to join in.
  - Allows the invite to be private (only visible to friends), or public (open to the community).
  - Allows members to RSVP for shared meals, so that the chef has control on meal size.
  - Allows multiple forms of exchange: pay the chef, bring ingredients for them, etc.

- **Rewards and Challenges:**
  - Participation in environmental challenges allows users to earn badges and points, which can be redeemed for rewards or discounts from partner businesses.

### Scope

The program involves with separate features: inventory management and recipe recommendation, surplus exchange and meal sharing platform, each requiring elaborate development on both front end, back end, and database, but are also realistic for a team of 4 people to develop within a semester.
